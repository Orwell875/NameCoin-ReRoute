I've been working on a small proof of concept code, that is basically a local namecoin DNS server. What it dose is relay all your DNS queries to 
your regular DNS server and for the .bit queries it makes a "fake" answer. It gets this "fake" answer from namecoind trough json interface. 
This gives you a now setup easy to use way of browsing .bit domains, witch works on all your applications and browsers.

As i sad it's a proof of concept and very buggy but it works (more or less)


How to use:
In the OS, set your preferred DNS server to 127.0.0.1 and your alternate to 8.8.8.8 (google DNS server).
This way you still have DNS when you stop this software  '

Remember to start namecoind with RPC user name test password test. Its hard coded now, should be changed

Now go to your browser and try gee.bit this should work, I've had problems with dot-bit.bit
